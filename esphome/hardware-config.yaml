# Hardware Configuration for 433MHz RF Sniffer
# ===============================================================
# Customize these settings for your specific hardware setup
# You need to recompile/flash the firmware after changing these settings

# ESP32 Board Configuration
esp32_board: esp32dev

# SPI Pins for CC1101
spi_clk_pin: "18"
spi_miso_pin: "19"
spi_mosi_pin: "23"

# CC1101 Pins
cc1101_cs_pin: "5"
cc1101_gdo0_pin: "13"  # Main data output pin

# GPIO Pin Assignments
status_led_pin: GPIO4 # WS2812/WS2811 LED for status indication
rf_receiver_pin: GPIO13 # CC1101 GDO0 pin - primary data pin for receiving RF signals

# CC1101 RF Settings
cc1101_frequency: 433.92MHz
cc1101_filter_bandwidth: 325kHz
cc1101_data_rate: "1000"

# LED Configuration
led_chipset: WS2811 # LED chipset (WS2811, WS2812B, etc.)
led_rgb_order: GRB # RGB order for your LED
led_num_leds: "1" # Number of LEDs in the chain

# RF Receiver Settings
rf_idle: 8ms # Idle time before considering signal complete
