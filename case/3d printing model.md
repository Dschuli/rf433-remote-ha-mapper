# 3D Printing Model

## Overview

You can directly use the provided STL files to print a suitable case for the 433MHz sniffer device, based on ESP32 and CC1101.

It's built for use with a breakout board for a 30-pin ESP32 and has enough space to accommodate Dupont jumpers as connectors.

See the [pictures](../pictures/) folder for a printed model with the mounted components.

## Fusion 360 Model

You also get a fully parametrized Fusion 360 3D model file (`Box ESP32+CC1101.f3d`). Some Fusion 360 skill is required for use.

### Customization Options

In case you need to make adjustments for your setup, such as:

- Different dimensions / mounting hole positions of your breakout board
- Direct use of the WS2811 LED without a lens (or no LED)
- Using simple screws instead of the threaded heat inserts
- More or less ventilation requirements

### Tips

- Sort the parameters by name for easier navigation
- Use very small dimensions (like 0.00001) if you don't want ventilation openings or a LED cutout
